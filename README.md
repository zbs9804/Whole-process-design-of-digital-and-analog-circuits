Induction lights are usually installed in the corridor to facilitate pedestrians while saving power. To design a corridor induction lamp control chip. There are four induction lights from downstairs to upstairs: lamp 1, lamp 2, lamp 3 and lamp 4. When pedestrians go up and down stairs, each lamp will automatically light up after sensing. If the induction signal disappears within 6S, it will be on for 6S. If the induction signal exists for more than 6S, the inductive signal will disappear and the lamp will turn off automatically after 3S. In order to avoid external interference misjudgment, if the induction signal duration is less than 0.3s, the induction lamp will not be turned on. In order to save energy, the last lamp will be turned off automatically within 0.5s after the next lamp is on (only one person's situation is considered).
The requirements are as follows:
Based on Modelsim or other EDA software, Verilog HDL language is used to complete the program editing and simulation verification. Key statements, modules or parameter variables should be clearly annotated.
